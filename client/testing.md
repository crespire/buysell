# End to end testing

Cypress should help us with end to end testing. I think we'll basically mock the backend via cy.intercept()

Resources:

* https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/network-requests

Areas to test
* User registration
* User Edit
* Post create
* Post edit
* Post delete

For posts, how do I automate testing file operations like upload, etc? Have I also validated it on the server side?
