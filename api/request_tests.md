# Automated Testing Suite - API

Just write request tests

Areas to test:
* Account creation
* Account Login
* Account Signout
* Account updates (pw/login)

Post testing will require using `multipart/form-data` so we should have some sample images to read from file.
* Post create 
* Post edit
* Post delete
